      <h2>Kanye West</h2>
      <p>Ye (/jeɪ/ YAY; born June 8, 1977), commonly known by his birth name Kanye West (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/ kahn-YAY), is an American rapper, record producer, and fashion designer.[3][4][5] He is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of all time. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, he gained recognition as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several artists and developing the "chipmunk soul" sampling style. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music.</p>
